The idea for this problem came from the HackerRank challenge "DP: Coin Change" found at https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-coin-change.

Environment:

Java 1.8.0

To run, execute the following:

javac DynamicProgrammingCoinChange.java

java DynamicProgrammingCoinChange.java

At runtime, specify the following:

1) First line contains two space-separated integers representing 'n' and 'm', representing 'n' dollars and 'm' distinct coins.

2) Second line contains 'm' space-separated integers representing the value for each coin 'c' of 'm'

The program will output an integer representing the number of ways we can make change for 'm' dollars given an infinite supply of 'm' types of coins
